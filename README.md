# How to ask questions about programming

Here is some tips on how to ask good questions.  
(in no particular order)

## What is a question?

It's a representation of a problem.  
You just need to show the problem.

It doesn't matter how you do it:
2 lines of code or indepth explanations.  
As far as the problem is understandable you are fine.

## Don't ask to do your job for you.

There is a line between asking questions
and asking for doing your job for you.

If you can do it yourself, that's the second and no one will "help" you with that.  
You are not asking for help, you just want to exploit people.

## Learn how to ask questions.

This is not something you will do once in a year.  
If you code that's your life now, so please do yourself a favor 
and learn how to ask the questions.  
Don't annoy the fuck out of people by asking poorly asked questions.  
They don't get paid for that, so they won't tolerate your bullshit.

## There is no stupid questions.

But there is poorly asked questions.
So don't be afraid to ask stupid questions,
but be afraid of asking them the stupid way.


## Avoid XY problem.

You want to hammer a nail, but you don't know how to(X),
so you grab a microscope and try do it with it.
After 2 nails the microscope cracks a little and you can't hammer
nails with it anymore(Y)

You ask "how to not get your microscope cracked?"(Y),
instead of "how do I hammer a nail?"(X).

Tell what the problem is(X), not the problem with your solution(Y).

## Provide a snippet of code that reproduces the problem.

Words can explain the problem, but they are not the problem itself.

## Cut off the bullshit.

Your code must reproduce the problem and nothing else.
By adding anything else you just waste their time.


## Don't make others do a dead end research

If you did any research before asking the question
that means the research is dead end,
so if you don't show it, 
they will waste time doing the same research.


## By asking good questions you helping as well.

If you have a question, chances are that many people have the same question,
so if you ask the questions the right way you would help a lot of people.


## Try to answer some quetions yourself.

It will help you understand how to ask quetions better,
because you will see what's actually work and what's not.
